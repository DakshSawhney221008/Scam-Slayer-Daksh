    - Test the real-time functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **WebSocket Connection Issues:**

    - Make sure your hosting platform supports WebSocket connections
    - Railway, Render, and Heroku all support WebSockets

2. **App Not Starting:**

    - Check that `package.json` has the correct start script
    - Verify all dependencies are listed in `package.json`

3. **Static Files Not Loading:**
    - Ensure the `public` folder is included in your deployment
    - Check that Express is serving static files correctly

### Getting Help:

-   Check the hosting platform's logs for error messages
-   Test locally first with `npm start`
-   Ensure all files are committed to your repository
