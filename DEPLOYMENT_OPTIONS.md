# 🚀 Best Deployment Options for SCam Slayer

## ⚠️ Why Vercel/Netlify Don't Work

**Vercel and Netlify are NOT suitable for Socket.IO applications** because:

-   ❌ Serverless functions have 10-second timeouts
-   ❌ No persistent WebSocket connections
-   ❌ Multiplayer features will fail
-   ❌ Players will disconnect frequently
